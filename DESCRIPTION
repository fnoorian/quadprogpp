Description: A fast Quadratic Programming solver is implemented using c++ solver library eiquadprog. Originally based on uQuadProg and QuadProg++, eiquadprog utilises Eigen linear algebra c++ templates, and is optimised by explicit vectorisation for SSE2/3/4. The solver is 4x to 5x faster than the Fortran based quadprog (as of version 1.5-5), as shown in the benchmarks included in the demos.
